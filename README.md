# My-code
This is the version of the gue game written in C with three levels of difficulty (easy, hard and very hard)
After selecting the level, the user has a the first trial as a bonus and the game starts the count after that.
If the user guesses the right answer, the game ends and asks if the user wants to play again and then repeats the whole process again until the user decides to quit
